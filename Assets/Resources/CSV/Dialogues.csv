Final-Good-2,Kai,,,You think anything is enough to make us turn our backs on you? You feel like home.,
,Rowe,,R,"No, you don’t understand.",
Final-Middle-2,Quinn,,,You told me earlier that I was important to you. You’re too important to all of us to ever lose.,
,Rowe,,R,You need to understand that you don’t need me.,
Final-Bad-2,Darci,,,"No matter what your mistake was, we still love you!",
,Rowe,,R,Mine’s a mistake no one should forgive.,
Final-Fail-2,Rowe,Sprites/Rowe_1,R,I doubt it.,

Final-Good-3,Darci,,,"You always try your hardest to help everyone, Rowe. It isn’t your fault!",
,Rowe,,R,"My hardest? If I tried my hardest, none of this would have ever happened.",
Final-Middle-3,Kai,,,We all would have done something if we’d really known. It’s not just you. ,

Final-Bad-3,Quinn,,,"I know bad things happen, Rowe, but… you can’t save everyone.",
,Rowe,,R,"I could have, Quinn, if I hadn’t been so thick in the head.",
Final-Fail-3,Rowe,Sprites/Rowe_3,R,Like hell. I'm useless.,

Final-Good-4,Quinn,,R,Darci and I can help.,
,Rowe,,R,But there was a right thing to do. I shouldn’t have let her be alone.,
Final-Middle-4,Darci,,,You don’t need anyone else. You can stand on your own.,
,Rowe,,R,But how she was doing was our problem. My problem. She was my friend.,
Final-Bad-4,Kai,,R,"But the blame still falls to me, no matter what you say.",
,Rowe,,R,I let her leave. I let her walk away.,
Final-Fail-4,Rowe,Sprites/Rowe_3,R,And now she’s gone.,
Final-Followup-4,Rowe,,R,Now a part of me is ripped out.,
,,,R,"And every time I close my eyes, I see her face.",

,,,R,"If she wanted to put up with me, flaws and all, why didn’t she stick around?",
Final-Good-5,Quinn,,,There’s too much beauty left in the world for you to torture yourself forever. You can’t give up.,
,Rowe,,R,"If I tried hard enough and kept pushing, I could have made her believe it, Kai!",
Final-Middle-5,Darci,,,"She wouldn’t have budged, Rowe. She didn’t want to believe how important she was to all of us.",
,Rowe,,R,"If she doesn’t get to be here, why should I get to be happy?",

,Rowe,Sprites/Rowe_3,R,How could she leave?,
,Rowe,Sprites/Rowe_3,R,Why would she leave me if I hadn’t done anything wrong?,
,Quinn,Sprites/Quinn_6,,"Because she was hurting, just like you are.",
,Quinn,Sprites/Quinn_6,,And she couldn’t see anything else.,
,Kai,Sprites/Kai_10,,She didn’t want to give herself the chance to feel okay.,
,Kai,Sprites/Kai_10,,"She deserved to, but she didn’t know how.",
,Darci,Sprites/Darci_6,,It was hard for her to see the love in the world when all she’d grown up knowing was pain.,
,Darci,Sprites/Darci_6,,"Sometimes, people leave. Not to hurt us, but because they don’t know any other way.",
,Kai,Sprites/Kai_8,,"Sometimes, people convince themselves that there’s nothing beyond all they’ve ever known.",
,Quinn,Sprites/Quinn_1,,They don’t believe they can feel good again.,
,Darci,Sprites/Darci_2,,But you can. You have to break the cycle of hurt for the people you love.,
,Rowe,Sprites/Rowe_3,R,But how can I? How am I supposed to feel like I deserve to be happy?,
